**Overview**

The website of a dessert cafe named "Bon appetit". The sited is based on the learning project from Coursera "Full Stack". It is possible to book a table there and 
look through a menu.

**Framework**

Here I used the Django framework and its modules. The backend is created with Python, in the frontend there are html, css, and a little bit of JavaScript code.  

**Opportunities**

The website consists of a few pages, where possible to watch a menu, book a table, read about the cafe, and look through all reservations.
